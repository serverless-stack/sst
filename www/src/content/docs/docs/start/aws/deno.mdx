title: Deno on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Deno app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build a hit counter using Deno and Redis. We'll the deploy it to AWS in a container using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/aws-deno) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Deno app.

```bash
deno init aws-deno
```

---

#### Init Deno Serve

Replace your `main.ts` with the following.

```js title="main.ts"
Deno.serve(async (_req) => {
  return new Response("Hello World!");
});
```

This starts up an HTTP server by default on port `8000`.

---

#### Add scripts

Add the following to your `deno.json`.

```json title="deno.json"
"tasks": {
  "dev": "deno run --allow-all main.ts"
},
```

This adds a `dev` script with a watcher.

---

#### Init SST

Make sure you have [SST installed globally](/docs/reference/cli).

```bash
sst init
```

This'll create an `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our Deno app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true });
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    loadBalancer: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "8000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "deno task dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with a bastion host, an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

:::note
By default, your service in not deployed when running in _dev_.
:::

The `dev.command` tells SST to instead run our Deno app locally in dev mode.

---

## 3. Add Redis

Let's add an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis cluster. Add this below the `Vpc` component in your `sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const redis = new sst.aws.Redis("MyRedis", { vpc });
```

This shares the same VPC as our ECS cluster.

---

#### Link Redis

Now, link the Redis cluster to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [redis],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the Redis cluster in our Deno app.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our Redis cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
sst dev
```

This will deploy your app, start a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab, and run your Deno app locally in the **MyServiceDev** tab.

---

## 4. Connect to Redis

We want the `/` route of our API to increment a counter in our Redis cluster. Let's start by installing the npm packages we'll use.

```bash
deno install npm:ioredis npm:sst
```

Add the relevant imports to your `main.ts`.

```ts title="main.ts" {5}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { Cluster } from "ioredis";

const redis = new Cluster(
  [{ host: Resource.MyRedis.host, port: Resource.MyRedis.port }],
  {
    dnsLookup: (address, callback) => callback(null, address),
    redisOptions: {
      tls: {},
      username: Resource.MyRedis.username,
      password: Resource.MyRedis.password,
    },
  }
);
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our Redis cluster with `Resource.MyRedis.*`.
:::

Let's update the `/` route.

```ts title="main.ts"
Deno.serve(async (_req) => {
  const counter = await redis.incr("counter");
  return new Response(`Hit counter: ${counter}`);
});
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's head over to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and it'll show the current hit counter.

You should see it increment every time you refresh the page.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll first add a `Dockerfile`. This is building our app by running our `build` script from above.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# https://docs.deno.com/runtime/tutorials/aws_lightsail/

FROM denoland/deno

EXPOSE 8000

USER deno

WORKDIR /app

ADD . /app

RUN deno install --entrypoint main.ts

CMD ["run", "--allow-all",  "main.ts"]
```

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
.sst
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Deno app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
âœ“  Complete
   MyService: http://prod-MyServiceLoadBalanc-491430065.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
